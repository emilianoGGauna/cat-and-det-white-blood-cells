# Blood Smear Image Categorization
## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to categorize 8 different types of blood smears from image data.

1. Data Collection & Preparation
Source: High-res images from medical databases or labs.
Annotation: Images annotated by medical professionals for accuracy.
Augmentation: Techniques like rotation, scaling, cropping to enhance dataset.
Data Split: 60% training, 15% validation, 25% test.
2. Model Development & Architecture
Pre-processing: Resize, normalize, and enhance images.
Architecture: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using PyTorch.
Training: Techniques like dropout & batch normalization used.
3. Model Evaluation
Validation: Use validation dataset to monitor training.
Metrics: Accuracy, F1 score, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Testing: Performance assessment on unseen data.
4. Deployment
## Integration: Platform (web/mobile app) for image upload and results.
Feedback Loop: User feedback for model improvement.
5. Limitations & Future Work
Variability: Performance may vary based on image quality and conditions.
Expanding Categories: Potential to include more blood smear types or specific cell anomalies.
